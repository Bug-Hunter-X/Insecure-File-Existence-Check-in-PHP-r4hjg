This code uses a non-standard way to check for the existence of a file using `@file_exists()`. The `@` symbol suppresses any error messages, which can make debugging difficult. If the file doesn't exist, it silently proceeds, potentially causing unexpected behavior.  Additionally, it directly uses the user-supplied filename without sanitization, leading to potential path traversal vulnerabilities.
